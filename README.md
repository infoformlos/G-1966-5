# Reimplementation of G-1966-5 by Marc Adrian

Marc Adrian was an austrian artist mainly involved with the "New Tendencies" movement of the European Neo-Avantgarde. He experimented with graphics and experimental video work and in 1966 also wrote some of the first computer programs to generate concrete poetry with random choices of words, font etc.

This reimplementation remains true to the original where it chooses randomly from the original words used by Adrian, as well as their poition, font size and the angle compared to a horizontal line. It comprises two notebooks. One where the words are placed on a matrix and one, where they are placed on a grid, which is closer to how historically computer graphics worked at the time.
